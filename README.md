# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a financial dataset containing customer-related information such as age, annual income, loan amount, credit score, repayment history, transaction count, and spending ratio.

The objective of this analysis is to understand data distribution, relationships between variables, and check normality before applying machine learning models.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Most variables show approximately normal distribution.
- Slight positive relationship observed between:
  - Annual Income & Loan Amount
  - Repayment History & Credit Score
- No strong multicollinearity detected.
- Some variables may require scaling before modeling.
